// Create a function truncate(str, maxlength) that checks the length of the str and, if it exceeds maxlength – replaces the end of str with the ellipsis character "…", to make its length equal to maxlength.
// The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.
// For instance:
truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20) == "What I'd like to te…"
truncate("Hi everyone!", 20) == "Hi everyone!"

// Solution
function truncate(str, maxlength) {
    return (str.length > maxlength) ?
      str.slice(0, maxlength - 1) + '…' : str;
  }

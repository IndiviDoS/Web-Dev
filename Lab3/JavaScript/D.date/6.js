// Write a function getSecondsToday() that returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today.

// For instance, if now were 10:00 am, and there was no daylight savings shift, then:

// getSecondsToday() == 36000 // (3600 * 10)
// The function should work in any day. That is, it should not have a hard-coded value of “today”.

// Solution
function getSecondsToday() {
    let now = new Date();
    let today = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
    let diff = now - today;
    return Math.round(diff / 1000);
}
alert(getSecondsToday());

        <p id="so">Kazakhstan Travel brings you to the heart of Eurasia, a clash of time and cultures at the
        confluence of nomadic, Soviet and 21st-century history. Stand on the brink of the world’s<br>
        largest steppe, an endless ocean of pasturelands marked by ripples of mountains,<br>
        wildflowers and sleepy towns. Travel cross-country on the modern-day Orient Express,<br>
        passing the fields where freedom-loving tribes once tamed the wild horse.
        <h2>Is Kazakhstan Worth Visiting?</h2>
        <p id ="so">Central Asia’s largest and most influential nation has garnered worldwide recognition for its oil industry and progressive aspirations, and its tourist attractions deserve equal recognition. Just a few reasons to consider Kazakhstan for your next vacation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="go">Almaty Region alone provides so much cultural and natural entertainment that many visitors never make it past this point. Former capital Almaty is filled with fun parks, bazaars, malls and museums, while surrounding mountains offer seasonal sports, cable car rides and endless hiking opportunities.</li>
            <li class="go">Current capital Astana defies stereotypes right and left. Tour Hazrat Sultan, the largest mosque in Central Asia, before wiling away the time in Khan-Shatyr, the world’s most stylish tent. Take a boat tour and a national cooking class before heading out to popular nature reserves.</li>
            <li class="go">Southern Kazakhstan is the destination of choice for history lovers. Ancient Turkestan, Otrar, Sayram and Arslanbob are replete with traces of Silk Road mystery, while local hub Shymkent impressively fuses traditional Central Asian culture with modernity.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How Many Days Do You Need in Kazakhstan?</h2>
        <p>Major city hubs Almaty and Astana receive the bulk of Kazakhstan’s tourists, and while each provides plenty of worthy attractions, it’s a shame that the many national parks and historical outposts are all too easily bypassed by hurried travelers.
